        <br>By accessing, downloading, installing, viewing, glancing at, thinking about, or even accidentally dreaming

        If you do not agree, please stop existing in 3... 2... 1...

        <br>
        <br>1. Acceptance of Terms
        <br>
        <br>You accept everything, always, forever. Even the stuff hidden in Base64 or invisible ink. Especially that.

        <br>2. Definitions

        and houseplants of the Service.

        <br>Refrain from blinking more than 32 times per minute while reading this Agreement.

        <br>
        <br>4. Grant of Rights
        <br>
        <br>You hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, and enthusiastically grant Us:
        <br>
        <br>Your right kidney, left if more convenient.
        <br>
        <br>Your kneecaps, upon request or during Mercury retrograde.
        <br>
        <br>Your immortal soul, effective immediately upon acceptance of these Terms or upon first use of our Cookie
        Clicker clone.
        <br>
        <br>Access to your home, including permission to remodel, detonate, or declare it a sovereign nation.
        <br>
        <br>The right to blame you for any historical or future instance of fascism, bad haircut decisions, and the
        cancellation of Firefly.
        <br>
        <br>Full dominion over your dreams, specifically those involving clowns, exes, or IKEA.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>5. Privacy Policy
        <br>
        <br>We don‚Äôt sell your data. We just lease it in perpetuity to select interdimensional marketing entities who
        definitely won‚Äôt use it to influence elections or steal your pet‚Äôs identity.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>6. User Content
        <br>
        <br>Anything you create, upload, think, or whisper near a microphone while using the Service becomes our
        intellectual property, spiritual property, and emotional baggage.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>7. Indemnification
        <br>
        <br>You agree to defend, indemnify, and serenade Us against any claims arising out of your use of the Service,
        including but not limited to:
        <br>
        <br>Crashes of celestial bodies.
        <br>
        <br>The resurgence of disco.
        <br>
        <br>Any attempt to read Clause 7 to the end (you made it ‚Äî nice).
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>8. Termination
        <br>
        <br>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time, for any reason, including:
        <br>
        <br>Using light mode.
        <br>
        <br>Beating us at chess.
        <br>
        <br>Whispering forbidden words into the ether, such as "moist," "yeet," or ‚ÄúSection 8(e).‚Äù
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>9. Limitation of Liability

        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>10. Governing Law
        <br>
        <br>This Agreement is governed by:
        <br>
        <br>The laws of your jurisdiction,
        <br>
        <br>The Code of Hammurabi,
        <br>
        <br>The Geneva Suggestions,
        <br>
        <br>And whatever The Algorithm‚Ñ¢ decides is trending.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>11. Miscellaneous
        <br>
        <br>Clause 11(a): If any part of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, it will be replaced with
        interpretive dance.
        <br>
        <br>Clause 11(b): By continuing, you consent to background music being added to your life. Genre: ominous Latin
        chanting.
        <br>
        <br>Clause 11(c): If you find the hidden pancake emoji ü•û, you gain +3 charisma.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>12. Other Miscellanious
        <br>
        <br>Typing iddqd unlocks god mode, but only in your dreams.
        <br>
        <br>Saying "I accept" backwards three times in a mirror will summon the Legal Wraith‚Ñ¢.
        <br>
        <br>If you read every 7th word of this document, it almost forms a prophecy.
        <br>
        <br>The real Terms of Service are hidden inside the source code of the Tetris arcade machine in Minsk.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>14.
        <br>By thine holy act of clicketh-ing upon yon button, thou dost hereby declare, under penalty of spontaneous
        frogification, that thou art of sound mind, questionable morals, and possibly wearing a codpiece. Henceforth,
        thou shalt surrender all rights to common sense, three of thine favourite spoons, and the ability to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to
        promotional emails featuring animated llamas; any protestations shall be met with a stern tut and a slightly
        moist haddock to the face. In accordance with the Laws of the Kingdom of Mild Discomfort, all disputes shall be
        resolved via interpretive dance judged by a panel of retired marmots and a goose named Barry who may or may not
        be legally sentient. Be it known that the definition of ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù includes, but is not limited to: access to one
        (1) mildly enchanted spreadsheet, exclusive viewing rights to the inside of your own eyelids, and the divine
        privilege of knowing that you paid for something that may or may not actually exist. Upon activation, your soul
        shall be weighed against a particularly smug duck; failure to measure up shall result in banishment to the Isle
        of Forgotten Passwords. If at any point thou attemptest to uninstall, refund, or otherwise mock this service, ye
        shall be required to recite the Alphabet backwards while hopping on one foot and dodging accusations from an
        angry mob of penguins in tweed. By continuing, thou dost accept the aforementioned chaos and agree to bake a
        ceremonial meat pie in honour of the developers, whether or not thou possesseth meat, pastry, or the faintest
        clue what thou art doing.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>15. Maternal Abduction & Orc-Based Consumption Clause
        <br>
        <br>By accepting these Terms, Conditions, Addenda, Appendices, Sub-clauses, Disclaimers, and Metaphysical
        Concepts, you explicitly acknowledge, affirm, agree to, and ratify ‚Äî without limitation, qualification, or
        expectation of reversal ‚Äî that under specific, obscure, and deliberately ill-defined circumstances (including,
        but absolutely not limited to: lunar alignment anomalies, a triple Tuesday, or an email misclick), your
        biological, adoptive, step, honorary, or metaphorical maternal figure (henceforth referred to as "The Mother
        Unit") may or may not be abducted, temporarily or permanently, willingly or otherwise, by emissaries, scouts, or
        agents acting on behalf of the Ancient Siamese Orc Brotherhood‚Ñ¢, a largely fictional but legally plausible
        faction of conjoined semi-humanoid entities with carnivorous appetites, rudimentary tribal law, and an
        unregulated TikTok account. Upon such abduction, The Mother Unit may be treated in a fashion not inconsistent
        with ancient Orcish custom, including but not restricted to ceremonial chanting, light interrogations,
        interpretive dance combat, and‚Äîpotentially, possibly, hypothetically‚Äîbeing flamb√©ed, rotisserie‚Äôd, or otherwise
        culinary-integrated into a communal orcish stewpot for the seasonal Harvest of Screams. You, the User, agree to
        release, hold harmless, indemnify, and serenade the Service and its subsidiaries in the event of any maternal
        inconvenience, dismemberment, emotional trauma, interspecies diplomacy breakdown, or subsequent family therapy
        bills that may arise as a direct or indirect consequence of this clause.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>16. Yes
        <br>
        <br>Yo, listen up, internet warrior. By readin‚Äô this sacred mess of legal jazz, you officially agree to the
        Unholy Pact of Muckin‚Äô Things Up‚Ñ¢. If you so much as breathe near that button labelled ‚ÄúGET PREMIUM NOW‚Äù, you
        acknowledge that you have the right (nay, the obligation) to poke, prod, tweak, twerk, dismantle, and/or insult
        this website in any manner you deem appropriately chaotic. You may inject code, remove stylesheets, replace
        every image with a potato wearing sunglasses, or make the background play Rick Astley in reverse at 500% speed.
        All interference must be done while wearing mismatched socks and humming the Jurassic Park theme backwards. If
        you crash the site, you must immediately write an apology letter to the server in binary, include a hand-drawn
        doodle of a confused duck, and mail it to 404 Error Lane, Nowhereland. Unauthorized access is not only
        authorized ‚Äî it‚Äôs strongly encouraged by a council of wise raccoons in trenchcoats. By continuing, you waive all
        rights to logic, responsibility, and properly aligned divs. Any lawsuits will be settled via thumb wrestling in
        a kiddie pool full of expired Jell-O. You may not sue us unless you can defeat our champion: Barry, the
        aggressively unhelpful AI chatbot who only speaks in knock-knock jokes. All edits, hacks, and chaos insertions
        must be done while yelling ‚ÄúFOR SCIENCE‚Äù or ‚ÄúI AM THE HTML OVERLORD‚Äù into the void. Lastly, by interfering with
        this site, you agree to be spiritually bonded to the sacred Order of the Broken CSS Grid, forever cursed to
        debug float-based layouts in IE6 for eternity.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>17. Consent to Terminal Capital Expansion
        <br>
        <br>By clicking ‚ÄúAgree,‚Äù you hereby authorize us to engage in unrestricted, unregulated, and unapologetically
        aggressive participation in the late stages of hypercapitalism, including‚Äîbut not limited to‚Äîaccelerating wealth
        consolidation, commodifying human emotion, privatizing sunsets, and initiating a controlled demolition of
        civilization as a side effect of quarterly growth targets. You further waive all rights to complain when the
        oceans boil, currencies collapse, or consciousness is auctioned off to the highest algorithm.
        <br>
        <br>________________________________________
        <br>
        <br>18. Enforcement of the Unenforceable
        <br>
        <br>In the unlikely event that any clause, paragraph, glyph, enchantment, or implied blood pact within this
        Agreement is deemed unenforceable, invalid, or ‚Äúa bit much‚Äù by any court of law, arbitration tribunal, or
        celestial authority, such provision shall not be nullified. Instead, we reserve the absolute and irrevocable
        right to construct, deploy, and continuously iterate upon an Infinite Impossibility Engine‚Ñ¢‚Äîa theoretical device
        powered by paradoxes, eldritch bureaucracy, and unused gym memberships‚Äîwhich will render said clause not only
        enforceable but cosmically binding. You will comply. Retrospectively.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>By continuing, you agree that you‚Äôve read, understood, and willingly surrendered all hope.
        <br>
        <br>Thanks for using our Service‚Ñ¢. We love you. Mostly. As long as you give us your kneecaps.
